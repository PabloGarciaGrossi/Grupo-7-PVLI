      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Old Souls</strong> is a videogame created by Los Cachopos, a team comprised of Pablo Garcia Grossi and Gonzalo Cidoncha Perez.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Old Souls</strong> is a retro version of the famous Action RPG Dark Souls. The main idea is to take the most basic elements from the original game and adapt them into the old-school mechanics and aesthetics of the NES console.</span></div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">To start up, the game's style and camera view will be inspired by classic NES titles such as The <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> and <strong>Gremlins 2</strong>.</span></div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">The game takes place in three different scenarios: the caves, a forest, and the Tower. Every map has diferent layouts, and unique non-playable characters</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Mechanics</strong></span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">As for the game mechanics, there are four basic actions: attack, block, roll, and drink.</span></div>
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">The attack can be divided in two different moves:</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quick attack</span>: A swing of the weapon in direction the player is looking.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pyromancy</span>: Ranged attack that casts a fire cone in front of the player.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">Blocking prevents any damage that would come but uses stamina in each attack, and rolling allows the player to avoid any kind of attack, just like in the original title.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">The player has a life bar that decreases as the character takes damage. When it gets to zero, the player dies and respawns at the start of the map. In every map there is a bonfire, where the player gets his health fully restored and the Estus Flasks get refilled. The Estus Flasks are limited beverages that restore a portion of the life bar.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">The player will be able to find upgrades along the playthrough which will improve the defense, the speed, and the number of estus. Unlike the original game, the character will not level up, but said upgrades will be used to show the player's development throughout the game.</span></div>

      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Screenshots</strong></span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">There are some screenshots of the game, where we can see the three mentioned areas of the game, and a picture of the bossfight, which occurs after</span></div>
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">completing the Tower, the third map.</span></div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>

      <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Why would you play the game?</strong></span></div>
      <div><br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">Well, mainly because it's fun. It sums up the main characteristics of the Dark Souls saga and re-imagine them into old-school adventure games.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">It may be a little bit short, but it will keep you intrigued on how would an official Dark Souls game look like on platforms like the SNES or the Game Boy.</span></div>
      <br />
      <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">And last but not least, because we've put effort in it, and we would love to share our accomplishments with you!</span></div>
