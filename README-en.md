# Old Souls
### Introduction
**Old Souls** is a videogame created by Los Cachopos, a team formed by Pablo García Grossi and Gonzalo Cidoncha Pérez.
Our game, **Old Souls**, is a retro versión of the famous Action RPG “Dark Souls”. The main idea is to take the most basic elements of the original game and transform them into the old-school mechanics and aesthetics of the NES console.
To start up, the visuals and the top view, both similar to titles as “The Legend of Zelda” and “Gremlins 2” of the mentioned console.

Moreover, the way that the player moves around the map is similiar, as a dungeon crawler, with several rooms and enemies along the way. Every room has different displays and lots of challenges.
### Mechanics
As for the game mechanics, there are three basic actions: attack, block and roll.
The attack can be divided in three different moves, just like the original game:
•	Quick attack: A swing of the weapon in direction the player is looking.

•	Power attack: Stronger tan the quick attack, but slower to perform.

•	Pyromancy: Ranged attack that casts a magic projectile in a straight line.

Blocking prevents any damage that would come from the front, and rolling evades any kind of attack, just like in the original title.
The player has a life bar that decreases as the carácter takes damage. When it gets to zero, the player diez and respawns in the last checkpoint, pictured as a bonfire. In the bonfire, the player gets to full health and the Estus Flasks get refilled. The Estus Flasks are beverages that restore a portion of the life bar. 
The player will be able to find upgrades along the playthrough, that will improve the attack and defense stats. Unlike the original game, the carácter will not level up, but said upgrades will depict the improvement of the player.
