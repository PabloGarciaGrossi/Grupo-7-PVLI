### Introduction

**Old Souls** is a videogame created by Los Cachopos, a team comprised of Pablo Garcia Grossi and Gonzalo Cidoncha Perez.

**Old Souls** is a retro version of the famous Action RPG *Dark Souls*. The main idea is to take the most basic elements from the original game and adapt them into the old-school mechanics and aesthetics of the NES console.
To start up, the game's style and camera view will be inspired by classic NES titles such as *The Legend of Zelda* and *Gremlins 2*.
The game takes place in three different scenarios: the caves, a forest, and the Tower. every map has diferent layouts, and unique non-playable characters

### Mechanics

As for the game mechanics, there are four basic actions: attack, block, roll, and drink.
The attack can be divided in two different moves:

�	Quick attack: A swing of the weapon in direction the player is looking.

�	Pyromancy: Ranged attack that casts a fire cone in front of the player.

Blocking prevents any damage that would come but uses stamina in each attack, and rolling allows the player to avoid any kind of attack, just like in the original title.
The player has a life bar that decreases as the character takes damage. When it gets to zero, the player dies and respawns at the start of the map. In every map there is a bonfire, where the player gets his health fully restored and the Estus Flasks get refilled. The Estus Flasks are limited beverages that restore a portion of the life bar. 
The player will be able to find upgrades along the playthrough which will improve the defense, the speed, and the number of estus. Unlike the original game, the character will not level up, but said upgrades will be used to show the player's development throughout the game.
