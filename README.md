### Introduction

**Old Souls** is a videogame created by Los Cachopos, a team comprised of Pablo García Grossi and Gonzalo Cidoncha Pérez.
**Old Souls** is a retro versión of the famous Action RPG “Dark Souls”. The main idea is to take the most basic elements from the original game and adapt them into the old-school mechanics and aesthetics of the NES console.
To start up, the game´s style and camera view will be inspired by classic NES titles such as “The Legend of Zelda” and “Gremlins 2”.

Moreover, the way that the player moves around the map is similar to a dungeon crawler, with several rooms and enemies along the way. Every room has different displays and lots of challenges.
### Mechanics
As for the game mechanics, there are three basic actions: attack, block and roll.
The attack can be divided in three different moves, just like the original game:
•	Quick attack: A swing of the weapon in direction the player is looking.

•	Power attack: Stronger tan the quick attack, but slower to perform.

•	Pyromancy or Magic: Ranged attack that casts a magic projectile in a straight line.

Blocking prevents any damage that would come from the front, and rolling allows the player to avoid any kind of attack, just like in the original title.
The player has a life bar that decreases as the character takes damage. When it gets to zero, the player dies and respawns in the last checkpoint, depicted as a bonfire. In the bonfire, the player gets his health fully restored and the Estus Flasks get refilled. The Estus Flasks are limited beverages that restore a portion of the life bar. 
The player will be able to find upgrades along the playthrough which will improve the attack and defense stats. Unlike the original game, the character will not level up, but said upgrades will be used to show the player´s development throughout the game.
